# global-coral-reefs
Code and analysis for reproducing the data and statistics from:
Lyons et al. (2023). New global area estimates for coral reefs from high-resolution mapping. _Cell Reports Sustainability_

## Note
- The `global_5m.dbf` file is compressed, so uncompress it, and then replace the original `.dbf` to use it

## R files
- `reef_analysis.R` analyses the global gridded data and produces the paper analyses and statistics
- `reef_error.R` performs the accuracy and error assessment, including confidence interval generation
